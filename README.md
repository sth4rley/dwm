# Customized dwm build
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

## Description
My custom version of dwm utilizes dwm flexipatch, which employs preprocessor directives to determine whether a patch should be included during the build. Essentially, this means that the compilation contains both the original code and the modified code, allowing you to select which patches to include and keeping only the necessary code.
